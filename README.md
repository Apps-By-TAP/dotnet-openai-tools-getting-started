# dotnet-openai-tools-getting-started
dotnet-openai-tools-getting-started is a tiny C#/.NET demo of OpenAI tool calling. It shows how to send a prompt that always triggers a function (e.g., get_random_token), execute the tool on your server, and pass the result back to the model to craft the final reply. Perfect as a minimal starter for building real agents. Includes 2-step loop.
